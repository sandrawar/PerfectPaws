# PerfectPaws- Flutter Aplication 

 ”PerfectPaws” is a mobile application (Android) which makes it possible for going-to-be owners to find
 a dog, needing adoption ideal for them, without the unpleasant experience of visiting many shelters or
 spending hours on their web pages. It helps connect volunteers from many places with people wanting
 to adopt a dog and makes process of adoption quicker, easier and safer.

## Aplication description

 The app features two distinct account types, each with tailored functionalities: Volunteer and Potential
 Owner. Volunteers can create an account after entering a verification code provided by their shelter or
 organization. Once registered, they can manage dog listings by adding dogs’ posters with images and
 descriptions, editing existing listings, and deleting them once the dog has been adopted. Volunteers can
 also list all their posters, track how many users have saved each of their dogs and communicate with
 potential adopters through an integrated messaging system, with the ability to delete conversations to
 maintain organization. On the other hand, Potential Owners can browse through dog listings, search
 by location to find dogs nearby, sort listings to view dogs with the least interest, save their favorite dogs
 for future reference, and send messages directly to volunteers managing the listings to ask questions or
 express interest in adopting. PerfectPaws supports internationalization with three available languages:
 English (featuring the American date format MM/DD/YYYY), Polish, and Spanish. Additionally,
 the app remembers user login details, allowing users to remain logged in even after restarting the
 application. PerfectPaws is a comprehensive solution that makes the adoption process accessible,
 efficient, and enjoyable for both volunteers and potential dog owners, helping dogs in need find loving
 homes faster than ever before.
